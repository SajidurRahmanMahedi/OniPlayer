## Welcome to OniPlayer

**OniPlayer** is a highly polished, distraction-free media playback ecosystem tailored for mobile (Android) and desktop (Windows, Arch Linux) platforms. Unified by a curated deep dark interface, vibrant sky-blue accents, and intuitive control schemes, OniPlayer ensures butter-smooth hardware-accelerated playback of practically any video or audio format.

Rather than compromising with generic wrapper players, OniPlayer has been engineered natively from the ground up:
*   **OniPlayer Android:** Built natively in Kotlin, emphasizing elegant touch gestures (volume/brightness swipes, pinch-to-zoom, slow scrubbing overlay), gorgeous grid layouts, resume-playback memory, and strict edge-swipe protection.
*   **OniPlayer Windows:** Built in Python using PyQt6, focusing on a fully keyboard-and-mouse-centric experience (including unique multi-key combinations and mouse scroll controls), distraction-free default fullscreen, auto-hiding OS cursor, and built-in standalone packaging.
*   **OniPlayer Linux:** Built in Python using PyQt6 for Arch Linux, featuring a custom VLC 3.0.23 build from source for optimal performance, with X11/Wayland compatibility and the same powerful keyboard-and-mouse controls as the Windows version.

*   **Intuitive Gesture Control:** Swipe up/down on the left side for brightness, on the right side for volume. Swipe horizontally for precise seek scrubbing with a clean overlay showing time differences (e.g., `+0:12` or `-1:05`).
*   **Screen Lock:** Long-press to lock screen controls, hiding all icons to prevent accidental navigation or touch inputs during playback.
*   **Thumbnail Optimization:** Leverages Glide v4 for rapid caching and display of local media thumbnails.
